#Emoji work with Python.

You need the following libraries to run this script:

SpeechRecognition

PyAudio

emoji

To install these use pip in your command prompt (windows)

pip install SpeechRecognition

pip install PyAudio

pip install emoji

You should note that goldcoast.py is a edited version of speech_recognition from this github library: https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/microphone_recognition.py 

The majority of the work in goldcoast.py was written by Uberi and NOT me.
